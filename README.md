# triple_analysis
Analysis of the first triple detection.

We go from the raw data to the significance of the event and the evaluation of the parameters.

This is based on the LIGO tutorials https://github.com/gwastro/PyCBC-Tutorials/tree/master/tutorial 

The *Tests* notebook contains several small test done in order to vizualize one effect or the other on the event.
